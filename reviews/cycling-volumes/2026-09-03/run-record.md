# Run record: `cycling-volumes`, run 2026-09-03

Stage: framing. Methodology v1.18.

This file records what happened to the brief between drafting and
freezing: every framing-check report, what the editor adopted and what
the editor rejected, and the commit the frozen brief sits in.

## Stage 1, framing

**Drafted** 2026-09-03 by Stew (Claude Opus 5) from the register entries
for `cycling-volumes` and the captured source `yegscoop-2026-08-26`. The
intake record is `intake.md` in this directory.

**Checked by** `prompts/framing-check.md`, run as
`codex exec -m gpt-5.6-sol -c model_reasoning_effort=high --skip-git-repo-check`,
a different vendor from the drafting seat. Reports are capped at three
(methodology v1.12).

The exact command, recorded because it differs from the seat command in
two ways that are tooling, not method: `--search`, so the checker can
verify that the instruments the brief names exist, which
`prompts/framing-check.md` requires of it, and `-s read-only`, matching
the precedent set on the active-transportation rerun. Both are the same
flags that run carried.

    codex --search exec -m gpt-5.6-sol -c model_reasoning_effort=high \
      -s read-only --skip-git-repo-check

| Report | Verdict | File | Response |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | REVISE, nine findings | `framing/check-1.md` | `framing/response-1.md` |

**Check 1, in one line:** the brief leaked expected findings in its
stakes headings, put floors under two ceiling claims so they could have
failed in their holders' own direction, left an accounting window open on
the participation claim, conflated riding with bike-lane use, and
overstated what the record can answer.

**What the editor did with it:** six findings adopted in full, two
adopted in a different form, one rejected. `framing/response-1.md` has
the reasoning for each. The rejected one is the checker's instruction to
leave `bike-lanes-look-empty` out of the panel; the brief instead
narrows the proposition to the metered lanes and says so on its face,
under the framing check's own rule that a general pattern offered with
examples is tested as the pattern, and check 9's rule that the brief
tests the nearest level the record answers.

**Freeze:** pending.

## Editorial decisions taken before the check

Recorded here so the check is checking a stated position rather than
guessing at one.

1. **Eight claims, not one.** The eight surviving claims measure
   different things over different denominators. They are briefed
   together because one body of evidence settles them, and they are
   reported separately because each is one assertion with one finding.
2. **`bike-lanes-look-empty` is tested as traffic volume, not as
   observation.** Ten people offered what they saw as evidence for a
   general statement about the lanes. The general statement is the claim.
   Nothing in the record can establish what a person driving past
   noticed, so the claim is operationalised on counter volumes at the
   corridors those holders named, with a predeclared fallback set.
3. **`heritage-days-bike-arrivals` is dropped at the brief.** Reason in
   `register-note.md` and in the brief.
4. **Cutoffs were fixed before any search.** The drafter wrote every
   threshold before looking anything up, then searched only to confirm
   the named instruments exist and are still published. `intake.md`
   records the two figures that appeared in those results in passing and
   that no cutoff moved afterwards.
